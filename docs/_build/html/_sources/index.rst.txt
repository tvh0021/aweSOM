aweSOM -- accelerated python library for Self-Organizing Maps
=============================================================

aweSOM is a parallel, JIT-optimized package for training and clustering large datasets using self-organing map (SOM). It is written in Python 3.10/11, and is written for the segmentation of current sheets in magnetized plasma turbulence simulations, but can also be used in generic multi-dimensional data.

Below is a quick start guide to set up aweSOM for a few generic datasets.
