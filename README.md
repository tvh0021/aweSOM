# aweSOM
Accelerated self-organizing map (SOM) and statistically combined ensemble (SCE)

This package combine a JIT-accelerated and parallelized implementation of SOM from [POPSOM](https://github.com/njali2001/popsom) and a GPU-accelerated implementation of SCE using [ensemble learning](https://github.com/mkruuse/segmenting-turbulent-simulations-with-ensemble-learning). It is optimized for plasma simulation data to segment current sheets in magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence.
